# flutter snippets for neovim
I'm so f@kn frustrated with vim-snippets, and so on, because i'm a noob, so i pass the Vs code snippets to the ultisnips format(.snippets).
 
 I know i could have tons off issues if you find one, you can say me. 
 Because i did everything with my hands and keyboard.


To add it, you only need to install the coc-snippets(from coc), and follow the ultisnips instructions that are within the coc-snippets repo.

I apologize I'm a completely noob on git, and Neovim. >:'(
